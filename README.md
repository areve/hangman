# Hangman

A simple Hangman game using modular code in JavaScript using ES2015 (ES6).

## Features
  * Words are stored in a server and not sent to the browser, to help prevent
    cheating (more could be done server-side though).
  * It uses a random word from a small dictionary set.

## Getting started

  * Use `npm install` to get all the dependencies.
  * Run the server using `npm run server`.
  * Start the website with `npm start` then browse to http://localhost:8080/bundle .
  * For the unit tests run `npm test`.
  * For the server-side unit tests run `npm run server-test`

## Compatibility

The program has been tested with node 4.2.6 on ubuntu and node 6.5.0 on windows.

Whilst everything works in Internet Explorer some of the styles work better in Chrome.
